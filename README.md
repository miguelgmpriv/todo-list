# todo-list

A todo app using JS, HTML and CSS. Currently desktop only.

Building this app was the hardest project yet, but also the one where I feel I learned the most. Working with closures, better naming of my functions and doing a better job of buidling functions that are not so intertwined with the global scope. I know I still have a lot of work to do on this, but I feel more ready now to take what I learned onwards to new projects.

This app currently

- Sorts tasks by projects
- Sorts tasks due today and in 7 days
- Can add new projects and tasks
- Can edit and delete tasks, projects
- Tasks display a title, description, due date and priority
- Uses local storage to save data
